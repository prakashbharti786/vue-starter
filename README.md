# Vue.js Starter Website
This package serves as a starter for you to build a single page Vue.js website. It uses vue-router and browserify to keep everyting nicely separated, and makes use of Laravel Elixir to avoid a huge Gulpfile (Laravel Elixir has nothing to do with the Laravel Framework, this package has no relation to that whatsoever).
